<!-- project philosophy -->
<img src="./readme/title2.svg"/>

> The goal of **LingoQuest** is to keep the process of learning a new language fun, easy, and effective. We believe that the method of learning should feel like an adventure itself: users explore, they interact, they develop their abilities in a natural fashion.

> Our application is based on three important ideas:

> 1. **Interactive Learning**  
   - People learn more when they are involved. Our app teaches languages through stories, games, and real-life situations, making it both exciting and useful.

> 2. **Practical Experience**  
   - It's more than just learning the language; it's putting life into it. We give learners situations and tasks which will help them communicate with confidence in real-life situations.

> 3. **Empowerment for All Users**  
   - Be it the learners attaining the ability to speak a new language or the tutors earning an amount through their expertise, we build a system where both benefit. We would want to make a nurturing yet rewarding community by giving them fairness and opportunity.

> In short, LingoQuest is designed to inspire users to enjoy language learning by giving them both the tools and realistic practice they need to succeed.

### User Stories
- As a learner, I want to select my learning level, so I can begin lessons that match my proficiency.
- As a learner, I want to participate in interactive stories, so I can practice the language in real-life scenarios.
- As a learner, I want to access vocabulary translations by tapping objects, so I can learn words in context.
- As a tutor, I want to correct learner exams and provide detailed feedback, so learners can improve their skills.
- As a tutor, I want to track the exams Iâ€™ve corrected, so I can manage my workload and ensure timely payment.
- As an admin, I want to ensure the AI-generated prompts are accurate and culturally appropriate, so users have a high-quality experience.
- As an admin, I want to track tutor performance, so I can ensure the quality of mentorship provided.

###  Lingo Quest is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
